# rdm - remote device management

This is a set of scripts/tools that permit setting up RDM, a botnet for good.

Be aware, this is a botnet framework, and requires that you either own your own ircd, or have permission from the oper on an existing ircd to start the services.

An updated release is coming after the pilot customer hits EOL.  The current state this code is in could be considered early-beta.
