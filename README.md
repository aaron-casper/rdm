# rdm - remote device management

This is a set of scripts/tools that permit setting up RDM, a botnet for good.

It includes a master/controller bot, agent bots, and a communications network between them.  It also includes a basic web interface backed by sqlite that tracks agent status.

Be aware, this is a botnet framework, and requires that you either own your own ircd, or have permission from the oper on an existing ircd to start the services.

This is as complete as I can make the public release.  Development of this project past this point was swept up in a contract agreement.  As such, I will not be updating this project further.  However, it will remain available to fork as you desire.

Reponsiblity for use of this software lies with the user.  I am not responsible or liable for any result, including damages not limited to bricked equipment or deceased pets.
