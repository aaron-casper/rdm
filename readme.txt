RDM Agent / Master stuff

The agent & master are both basically just IRC bots.

They join a server, join a channel, and issue commands and statistics
back and forth.

Pretty simple.  This is a very early, rough version.

I want to keep this all open for people to continue developing.

It's rough, really rough.

Enjoy,
